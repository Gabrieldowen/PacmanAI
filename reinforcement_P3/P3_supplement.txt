Q1#######################
QS1.1: 
The first thing done is to get the possible action from the given state. then for each of those actions use getTransitionStatesAndProbs 
to get all the possibilities for states from that action  with their probabilities. Then calculate the reward according to that and change
maxReward if it is greater. Then return the max action.

QS1.2:
This one is very similar to the previous question. We start by getting the transition states and probabilities since we are given the action. Then for each 
possibilities we add it to the qValue times their probabilities.

QS3.1: 
Q5#######################

QS5.1:

First we find the legal actions for the current state. Then choose a action using
epsilon greedy. This results in either a random move or the max action based of q value
