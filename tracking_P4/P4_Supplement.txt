QS3.1 [option]:



QS7.1: Test 2 and 3 are where the differences in shading appear. This is because the agents in 1 and 4 are random agents,
so they are equally likely to be anywhere in the grid. The agents in 2 and 3 move south, so the belief is higher that the ghost
will be in the south. So, on 2 and 3, since the ghost is believed to more likely be in the south, the squares in the south are darker.
